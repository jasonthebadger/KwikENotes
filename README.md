# Kwik-E-Notes

A lightweight note-taking program

Requires .NET Framework 3.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0 FINAL - WILL NOT BE UPDATED FURTHER BY ME!

Usage:

Type what you want in the Text Box and once you're done and would like to save hit the 'save' button.

Save Button: By default, This will open up your documents folder, there you may choose to save your file there or pick another folder. Files are saved with a *.kwk extension. Despite this, they are just standard text files and can be re-opened with any text editor.

Open: Opens a *.kwk file and by default, opens your documents folder. Any *.kwk files may be opened by Kwik-E-Notes and will display any text contain in the Text Box.

Why *.kwk? - I wanted a program that takes simple notes. My documents folder is filled with random .txt files, So I decided to use a unique extension to differenciate my notes from ordinary text files.

Permissions:

You may do what you like with this Program and the Source code that makes it up. There's nothing particulary special about the Program and I've used it as a learning tool for my own C# knowledge. - Feel free to add/improve on it as you like!
